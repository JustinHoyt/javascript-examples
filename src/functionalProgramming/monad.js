/**
 * we're writing 'chain' a lot now. can we abstract that away? Kleisli to the
 * rescue!
 *
 * While a regular category models composition of functions, a Kleisli
 * category models “composition of effects,” or “composition of monads.” This
 * category has all of the same objects your initial category had, but instead
 * of our simple f :: A -> B maps, we need f :: A -> m B where m is the monadic
 * type providing the abstraction we need and, by definition, implements chain.
 * In lieu of raising the abstraction, instead of R.compose, we need a
 * higher-level composition as well, smart enough to chain those monads or
 * containers seamlessly, called composeK (for Kleisli, of course). composeK has
 * the following form, taking 3 Kleisli functions:
 *
 * R.composeK(h, g, f) = R.compose(R.chain(h), R.chain(g), R.chain(f))
